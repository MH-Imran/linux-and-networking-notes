# Wireshark Notes & Labs

This folder contains my Wireshark practice notes as I learn how to analyze network traffic from a SOC analyst’s point of view.

I’m using Wireshark mainly to understand how normal network activity looks before moving on to detecting suspicious behavior. The goal here is not to master every protocol, but to become comfortable reading traffic and asking the right questions.

## What I’m practicing here
In these labs, I focus on:
- DNS queries and responses
- Basic HTTP requests
- TCP connection behavior
- Source and destination IPs
- Understanding what “normal” traffic looks like

I intentionally keep the labs simple and practical.

## How I’m using Wireshark
- Short capture sessions
- Controlled traffic (normal browsing)
- Heavy use of filters instead of scrolling through everything
- Writing observations in my own words

I don’t try to understand every packet — I focus only on what matters at my current stage.

## About these notes
These notes are for learning, not documentation perfection.  
Some explanations may be brief or incomplete, and that’s expected. I update them as my understanding improves.

## What’s next
As I progress, I plan to:
- Analyze more log + traffic scenarios together
- Connect network activity to Windows event logs
- Apply this knowledge in SOC-style investigations

Learning in progress.
